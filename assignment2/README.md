Learning Objective:  I am working with Healthcare Analytics Company in India & USA. The Company, Sanjeevani EHR (S-EHR), conducts population data by conducting Health Camp. As part of the storing of the data, the company project management approached me to create a simple Web App that stores data in real-time.

Since, S-EHR conducts health camps in remote parts of the world, one of the issues they constantly encounters is network connectivity. During the voice of customer, the management of the company expressed the need to store the data within the browser for later upload to Cloud data centers.

Use: HTML Browser storage - SQL
